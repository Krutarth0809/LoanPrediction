Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Customers first apply for a home loan after that company validates the customer’s eligibility for a loan. The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling out the online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customer segments, that are eligible for loan amounts so that they can specifically target these customers.

It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In these kinds of problems, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variables (s). Classification can be of two types:

Binary Classification:- In this, we have to predict either of the two given classes. For example: classifying the “gender” as male or female, predicting the “result” as to win or loss, etc.

MultiClass Classification:-  Here we have to classify the data into three or more classes. For example: classifying a “movie’s genre” as comedy, action, or romantic, classifying “fruits” like oranges, apples, pears, etc.

Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces at least once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a lot of man-hours at the end of a retail bank.
